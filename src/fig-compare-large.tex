  \caption{Time taken by Hornet, Gunrock, PIGO, and GVEL for reading Edgelist and converting it to CSR on 13 different graphs. PIGO and GVEL are not visible on this scale - they are significantly faster than Hornet and Gunrock. The graph loading time for Hornet is not shown for \textit{uk-2002}, \textit{it-2004}, and \textit{sk-2005} graphs as it crashed while loading.}
