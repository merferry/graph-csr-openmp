In conclusion, this study introduces GVEL, an optimized approach for efficient Edgelist reading and Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) conversion. Utilizing memory-mapped IO, a technique known for its efficiency in handling large datasets, GVEL outperforms established frameworks such as Hornet, Gunrock, and PIGO by $78\times$, $112\times$, and $1.8\times$ respectively, in CSR reading. For Edgelist reading, GVEL demonstrates a $2.6\times$ speedup over PIGO, and achieves a Edgelist read rate of $1.9$ billion edges/s. Looking ahead, future work could focus on extending GVEL to accommodate dynamic graphs which evolve over time, instead of CSR which is not amenable to dynamic updates. This would contribute to enhancing the adaptability and versatility of GVEL in dynamic graph processing scenarios.
